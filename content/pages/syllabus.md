Course Overview
---------------

This course covers the analysis and design of digital integrated circuits using CMOS technology. The course emphasizes design, and requires extensive use of MAGIC for circuit layout, and HSPICE and IRSIM for simulations.

Material is also derived from the _Journal of Solid-state Circuits_ and the _International Solid-state Circuits Conference_ proceedings.

Prerequisites
-------------

Basic device physics ([6.012](/courses/6-012-microelectronic-devices-and-circuits-fall-2005) or equivalent) and basic logic design ([6.004](/courses/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2009) or equivalent).

Grading
-------

There is a significant emphasis on the **design** aspect of the digital design process. The grade is based on problem sets, one design project, and two in-class quizzes. The final grade is calculated approximately using the following weights:

1.  Problem Sets (5) 20%
2.  Quiz #1 25%
3.  Quiz #2 25%
4.  Final Design Project 30%
